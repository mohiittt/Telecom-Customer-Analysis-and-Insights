# Telecom-Customer-Analysis-and-Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer retention for a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and provide insights to improve retention strategies. The project was initiated after the Retention Manager requested a detailed dashboard to visualize key retention factors.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis, covering:
- **Churn Patterns:** Identifying customers who left in the past month.

- **Account Details:** Exploring contract types, payment methods, and billing trends.
- **Demographic Data:** Evaluating customer attributes like age, gender, dependents, and partners.
- **Support Interactions:** Assessing the number of administrative and technical tickets opened.

## 🔍 Key Findings
